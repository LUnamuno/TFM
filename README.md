This repository collects the code and extra files of my Master's Final Project. 
For data protection reasons, the database is not available. 

The order of execution would start with the Preprocessing folder,
then the Descriptive folder and finally the GLMM and Random Forest Models 
executed for each of the three binary classification models performed.
